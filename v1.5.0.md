## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/index), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/pxe-boot-install/). A [net install ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/net-install), which contains only the core OS components, is also now available. For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Harvester v1.5.0 installer checks if the hardware meets the [minimum requirements](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/requirements/#hardware-requirements) for production use. If any of the checks fail, installation is stopped and warnings are printed to the system console.
> 
> You can disable this behavior during iPXE installation (for testing purposes) by adding the kernel parameter `harvester.install.skipchecks=true` when you boot the system. For more information, see [Useful Kernel Parameters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/pxe-boot-install#harvesterinstallskipcheckstrue).

## Upgrades

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/upgrade/index).

## Highlights

### Experimental Features

#### Longhorn V2 Data Engine Enhancements

Harvester v1.5.0, which uses Longhorn v1.8.1, supports the creation of virtual machine images and boot volumes using the V2 Data Engine, and live migration of virtual machines with attached V2 volumes. To leverage the enhancements, you must create a new V2 StorageClass and then use it to create images and volumes after upgrading to Harvester v1.5.0. V2 volumes created using Harvester v1.4.x remain non-migratable after the upgrade.

### Fully Supported Features

#### Third-Party Storage Support

Harvester now supports provisioning of root volumes and data volumes using external container storage interface (CSI) drivers. This enhancement allows you to select drivers that meet specific requirements, such as performance optimization or seamless integration with existing storage solutions.

Once the CSI driver is installed and the Harvester cluster is configured, an external storage solution can be used to store and manage virtual machine images, store virtual machine disks on volumes provisioned by the CSI driver, and perform other critical storage functions.
