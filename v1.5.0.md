# Harvester v1.5.0 Release Notes

This release introduces several features, enhancements, and bug fixes that improve system quality and the overall user experience. The documentation is available at https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5.

The Harvester team appreciates your contributions and looks forward to receiving feedback regarding this release.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) will reach the end of its life on **July 31, 2025**. Harvester **v1.6.0** and later versions will not support RKE. Switching to RKE2, which provides a more secure and efficient environment, is recommended.
>
> In-place upgrades are not an option, so you must [create new RKE2 clusters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/rancher/node/rke2-cluster) and migrate the workloads from your existing RKE clusters (known as replatforming). For more information, see [RKE End of Life](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021513).

## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/index), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/pxe-boot-install/). A [net install ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/net-install), which contains only the core OS components, is also now available. For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Harvester v1.5.0 installer checks if the hardware meets the [minimum requirements](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/requirements/#hardware-requirements) for production use. If any of the checks fail, installation is stopped and warnings are printed to the system console.
> 
> You can disable this behavior during iPXE installation (for testing purposes) by adding the kernel parameter `harvester.install.skipchecks=true` when you boot the system. For more information, see [Useful Kernel Parameters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/pxe-boot-install#harvesterinstallskipcheckstrue).

## Upgrades

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/upgrade/index).

## Highlights

### Experimental Features

#### Longhorn V2 Data Engine Enhancements

Harvester v1.5.0, which uses Longhorn v1.8.1, supports the creation of virtual machine images and boot volumes using the V2 Data Engine, and live migration of virtual machines with attached V2 volumes. To leverage the enhancements, you must create a new V2 StorageClass and then use it to create images and volumes after upgrading to Harvester v1.5.0. V2 volumes created using Harvester v1.4.x remain non-migratable after the upgrade.

[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRE7xR83uWo) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/advanced/longhorn-v2/) | GitHub issues: [#7521](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7521) and [#7522](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7522)

### Fully Supported Features

#### Third-Party Storage Support

Harvester now supports provisioning of root volumes and data volumes using external container storage interface (CSI) drivers. This enhancement allows you to select drivers that meet specific requirements, such as performance optimization or seamless integration with existing storage solutions.

Once the CSI driver is installed and the Harvester cluster is configured, an external storage solution can be used to store and manage virtual machine images, store virtual machine disks on volumes provisioned by the CSI driver, and perform other critical storage functions.

[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDK3lmKU9qI) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/advanced/csidriver) | GitHub issues: [#1199](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/1199) and [#2272](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2272)

#### ARM64 Support

Harvester v1.5.0 fully supports deployment on hosts with ARM architecture. This includes add-ons, which were previously packaged only for AMD64-based hosts, and upgrade paths for ARM-only clusters. Harvester on ARM is fully tested, stable, and ready for mission-critical workloads.
