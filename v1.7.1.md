## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/install/index), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/install/pxe-boot-install/). A [net install ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/install/net-install), which contains only the core OS components, is also now available. For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with v1.7.0, the installation process includes a mandatory step for configuring the login password for the default `rancher` user account.

## Upgrades

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/upgrade/index).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Harvester v1.7 transitions from wicked to NetworkManager for network management. If the management interface configuration was modified after installation, manual steps are required before upgrading to prevent errors. For more information, see [Migration from wicked to NetworkManager](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/upgrade/v1-6-x-to-v1-7-x#migration-from-wicked-to-networkmanager).
