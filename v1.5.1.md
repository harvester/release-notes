# Harvester v1.5.1 Release Notes

This release introduces several features, enhancements, and bug fixes that improve system quality and the overall user experience. The documentation is available at https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5.

The Harvester team appreciates your contributions and looks forward to receiving feedback regarding this release.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> A [Longhorn issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11158) causes virtual machines that use migratable [RWX volumes](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/rancher/csi-driver/#rwx-volumes-support) to restart unexpectedly when the CSI plugin pods are restarted. The issue affects Harvester v1.4.x, v1.5.0, and v1.5.1.
>
> You can work around it by disabling the **Storage Network for RWX Volume Enabled** setting on the [embedded Longhorn UI](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/troubleshooting/harvester/#access-embedded-rancher-and-longhorn-dashboards). The issue will be fixed in Longhorn {versions}, which will be included in Harvester {versions}. For more information, see GitHub issues [#8534](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/8534) and [#11158](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11158).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) will reach the end of its life on **July 31, 2025**. Harvester **v1.6.0** and later versions will not support RKE. Switching to RKE2, which provides a more secure and efficient environment, is recommended.
>
> In-place upgrades are not an option, so you must [create new RKE2 clusters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/rancher/node/rke2-cluster) and migrate the workloads from your existing RKE clusters (known as replatforming). For more information, see [RKE End of Life](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021513).

## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/index), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/pxe-boot-install). For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Harvester v1.5.1 installer checks if the hardware meets the [minimum requirements](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/requirements/#hardware-requirements) for production use. If any of the checks fail, installation is stopped and warnings are printed to the system console.
> 
> You can disable this behavior during iPXE installation (for testing purposes) by adding the kernel parameter `harvester.install.skipchecks=true` when you boot the system. For more information, see [Useful Kernel Parameters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/pxe-boot-install#harvesterinstallskipcheckstrue).
