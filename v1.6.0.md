## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/index), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/pxe-boot-install/). A [net install ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/net-install), which contains only the core OS components, is also now available. For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Harvester v1.6.0 installer checks if the hardware meets the [minimum requirements](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/requirements/#hardware-requirements) for production use. If any of the checks fail, installation is stopped and warnings are printed to the system console.
> 
> You can disable this behavior during iPXE installation (for testing purposes) by adding the kernel parameter `harvester.install.skipchecks=true` when you boot the system. For more information, see [Useful Kernel Parameters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/pxe-boot-install#harvesterinstallskipcheckstrue).

## Deprecations and Removals 

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) reached the end of its life on July 31, 2025. This means that you will not be able to run Rancher-provisioned RKE clusters on Harvester v1.6.0. Replatforming to RKE2, which offers better security and efficiency, is strongly recommended.

Replatforming involves [creating new RKE2 clusters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/rancher/node/rke2-cluster) and subsequently migrating the workloads from your existing RKE clusters. In-place migration from RKE to RKE2 is not an option because of possible data loss. For more information, see [RKE End of Life](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021513).
