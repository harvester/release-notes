## Downloads

### AMD64

#### Full ISO


#### Net Install ISO


### ARM64


## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/index), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/pxe-boot-install/). A [net install ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/net-install), which contains only the core OS components, is also now available. For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Harvester v1.6.0 installer checks if the hardware meets the [minimum requirements](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/requirements/#hardware-requirements) for production use. If any of the checks fail, installation is stopped and warnings are printed to the system console.
> 
> You can disable this behavior during iPXE installation (for testing purposes) by adding the kernel parameter `harvester.install.skipchecks=true` when you boot the system. For more information, see [Useful Kernel Parameters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/pxe-boot-install#harvesterinstallskipcheckstrue).

## Upgrades

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/upgrade/index).

## Highlights

### Experimental Features

#### Kube-OVN Operator

The `kubeovn-operator` add-on is a tool for managing Kube-OVN as a secondary container network interface (CNI) on Harvester clusters. Kube-OVN provides advanced software-defined networking (SDN) capabilities such as virtual private cloud (VPC) and subnets for virtual machine workloads. When you enable the add-on, it deploys Kube-OVN to your Harvester cluster and creates the default `Configuration` CRD, which defines the desired state of the Kube-OVN installation.

[Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/advanced/addons/kubeovn-operator) | [GitHub issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7413)

#### Overlay Network


#### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)


#### Subnet Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Isolation between virtual machines is typically achieved using either VLANs (in traditional networks) or virtual switches (in Kube-OVN). If you want to isolate virtual machines within the same virtual switch network, you can enable ACLs on subnets to achieve the required micro-segmentation.

### Fully Supported Features

#### CPU and Memory Hotplug

Starting with Harvester v1.6.0, you can increase a virtual machine's CPU and memory resources while it is running. To use this feature, you must enable CPU and memory hotplug when you create the virtual machine. Once the virtual machine is created, you can add more CPU and memory resources at any time. Harvester automatically migrates the virtual machine to a node that has the necessary resources.

[Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/vm/cpu-memory-hotplug) | [GitHub issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/5835)

#### Online Volume Expansion

Harvester v1.6.0 allows you to expand volumes that are in use, as long as the underlying storage provider supports the feature. This works for volumes that are attached to a running virtual machine, or that have persistent volume claims (PVCs) connected to a running pod in a guest cluster.

The Longhorn V1 Data Engine fully supports online volume expansion, but the V2 Data Engine currently does not support it. For third-party storage, Harvester blocks online volume expansion requests by default. To allow such requests, you must use the `csi-online-expand-validation` setting to validate the storage provider.

[Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/volume/edit-volume#online-volume-expansion) | GitHub issues: [2811](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2811) and [7358](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7358)

#### VM Migration Network

By default, Harvester migrates virtual machines over the built-in cluster network `mgmt`, which is limited to one interface and shared with cluster-wide workloads. If network segregation is required, you can configure a VM migration network to isolate migration traffic and improve bandwidth utilization.

Configuring a VM migration network involves enabling the `vm-migration-network` setting and constructing a Multus `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD. Once the setting is applied, all `virt-handler` pods are restarted to apply the new network configuration.

## Deprecations and Removals 

### Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)

RKE reached the end of its life on July 31, 2025. This means that you will not be able to run Rancher-provisioned RKE clusters on Harvester v1.6.0. For better security and efficiency, you may want to replatform to RKE2. This process involves [creating new RKE2 clusters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/rancher/node/rke2-cluster) and migrating existing workloads from the old RKE clusters. In-place migration from RKE to RKE2 is not an option because of possible data loss. For more information, see [RKE End of Life](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021513).

### `install.wipedisks` setting

This setting was removed from Harvester v1.5. If you want to clear disk partitions with the `COS_OEM` label, use [`install.wipe_all_disks`](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/harvester-configuration#installwipe_all_disks) and [`install.wipe_disks_list`](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.6/install/harvester-configuration#installwipe_disks_list) instead.
