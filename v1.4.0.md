## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/iso-install/), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/pxe-boot-install/). A [net install ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/net-install), which contains only the core OS components, is also now available. For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Harvester v1.4.0 installer checks if the hardware meets the [minimum requirements](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/requirements/#hardware-requirements) for production use. If any of the checks fail, installation is stopped and warnings are printed to the system console.
> 
> You can disable this behavior during iPXE installation (for testing purposes) by adding the kernel parameter `harvester.install.skipchecks=true` when you boot the system. For more information, see [Useful Kernel Parameters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/pxe-boot-install#harvesterinstallskipcheckstrue).

## Upgrades

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/upgrade/index).

## Highlights

### Experimental Features

#### Longhorn V2 Data Engine Support

The Longhorn V2 Data Engine harnesses the power of the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) to significantly reduce I/O latency while boosting IOPS and throughput. The result is a high-performance storage solution that is capable of meeting diverse workload demands. 

In this release, you can use the V2 Data Engine to create new volumes that must be added to virtual machines as extra disks. More functionality, including live migration and volume cloning, will be made available in future releases.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/9rdwVBC8gd0) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/advanced/longhorn-v2) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/5274)

#### Volume Encryption and Decryption

Harvester v1.4.0 allows you to encrypt and decrypt block volumes, including boot volumes (virtual machine images) and data volumes, with a single key. This feature enhances security by ensuring that data stored in volumes is encrypted and can be decrypted when attached to virtual machines. 

The encryption mechanism utilizes the Linux kernel module dm_crypt and the command-line utility cryptsetup. Using the feature requires the creation of a Kubernetes secret to be used as the dm_crypt passphrase, and a StorageClass that contains encryption-related fields.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/klpA8SF_NF0) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/volume/volume-security) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3129)

#### Local Storage Support

Harvester v1.4.0 allows you to use local storage on the host to create persistent volumes with better performance and latency. This functionality is made possible by LVM, which provides logical volume management facilities on Linux.

To use local storage for volume creation, you must install and enable the **harvester-csi-driver-lvm** add-on, which is a CSI driver that supports local path provisioning through LVM. The add-on is not packaged into the Harvester ISO, but is available in the [experimental-addons](https://github.com/harvester/experimental-addons) repository.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/NItyd6dhNPI) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/advanced/addons/lvm-local-storage) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/5724)

### Fully Supported Features

#### Third-Party Storage for Diskless Servers

Harvester can now be installed on and booted from external disks. This is particularly useful in environments where hosts have NICs or HBA cards that support booting from external iSCSI devices or SAN storage arrays. Such diskless systems are common in large datacenters.

The iSCSI target must be configured before Harvester is installed. During installation, you must provide a configuration file that contains multipath and additional kernel arguments, which are added to the installed operating system.

[Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/external-disk-support) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/5150)

#### RWX Volumes for Guest Cluster Workloads

Workloads running on guest clusters may require read-write-many (RWX) volumes for backups and other purposes. Harvester v1.4 allows you to create RWX StorageClasses and associated volumes that can be attached to workloads through the Harvester CSI driver.

To create RWX volumes, you must first create an RWX StorageClass on both the host Harvester cluster and the guest cluster, and an associated RWX PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). The RWX PVC must be specified when creating pods for workloads that require RWX volumes.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/5kHelpt1lUs) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/rancher/csi-driver#rwx-volumes-support) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/1992)

#### Virtual Machine Restoration in a New Harvester Cluster

In Harvester v1.4.0, each virtual machine backup includes the corresponding virtual machine image, allowing you to easily restore those images in a new cluster. 

The new Harvester controller automatically syncs the virtual machine images with the new cluster, except when a virtual machine image with the same name or display name already exists in it. Automatic syncing eliminates the need for manual uploading and configuration of virtual machine images on the new cluster, which was required in earlier Harvester versions.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/c7eancLPDQY) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/vm/backup-restore/#restore-a-new-vm-on-another-harvester-cluster) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2237)

#### Scheduled Virtual Machine Backups and Snapshots

Harvester v1.4.0 supports the creation of virtual machine backups and snapshots on a scheduled basis. You can suspend, resume, and update the schedule at runtime.

A cron expression is required for defining the schedule properties. You can specify the maximum number of up-to-date backups or snapshots to be retained. When this value is exceeded, Harvester deletes the oldest backups or snapshots.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/98PwgzxdpUU) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/vm/backup-restore#scheduling-virtual-machine-backups-and-snapshots) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2756)

#### Virtual Machine Snapshot Space Management

Volumes consume extra disk space in the cluster whenever you create a new virtual machine backup or snapshot. To manage this, you can configure space usage limits at the namespace and virtual machine levels. 

The configured values represent the maximum amount of disk space that can be used by all backups and snapshots. No limits are set by default.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/slK9oB8g8W0) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/vm/backup-restore#vm-snapshot-space-management) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/4478)

#### Defined Virtual Machine Behavior During Node Maintenance

Harvester v1.4.0 allows you to define the behavior of individual virtual machines when maintenance mode is enabled on a node. In earlier Harvester versions, enabling maintenance mode results in an attempt to migrate all virtual machines to other nodes in the cluster.

Using a new label, you can force certain virtual machines to shut down or restart instead of migrating to other nodes. The value of the label also determines if those virtual machines remain on the current node or are scheduled elsewhere. In addition, you can use a container lifecycle hook to execute a special command before shutting down a virtual machine.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/wuUbxFJFaek) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/host/#node-maintenance) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/5069)

#### USB Passthrough

USB devices that are attached to nodes can now be passed through by the Harvester hypervisor to allow direct access from virtual machines. This is accomplished through the pcidevices-controller add-on. 

USB passthrough is different from PCI passthrough in that individual devices (instead of the USB controller itself) are passed through. This allows the node and virtual machines to use USB devices in the same controller, but not the same device at the same time.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/dUncv-QzCIg) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/advanced/addons/pcidevices#usb-devices) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/1710)

#### CPU Pinning

Harvester now supports CPU pinning, which binds physical CPU cores to a virtual machine and removes those dedicated cores from the shared CPU pool. To use this feature, you must first enable the Kubernetes CPU Manager on the Harvester nodes, and then enable CPU pinning when you create the virtual machine.

The CPU Manager feature improves CPU resource allocation in Kubernetes clusters, ensuring that workloads with strict performance requirements receive stable CPU resources. This is especially important for applications that require predictably high performance and low latency.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/agjHEPdXsio) | [Documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/vm/cpu-pinning) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2305)
