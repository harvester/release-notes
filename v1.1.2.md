# Harvester v1.1.2 Release Note

This release follows Harvester v1.1.1, the documentation is available at https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1.

# Important information about Rancher support

If you are using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you will not be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying/updating guest clusters. This issue has been documented in detail in [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).

To resolve this issue, there are two options available:
- Upgrade your Harvester cluster to v1.1.2.
- Apply a manual patch to the `harvester-csi-ccm-versions` setting:
    ```
    $ kubectl edit settings.harvesterhci.io harvester-csi-ccm-versions

    # and patch the default value as below
    default: '{"harvester-cloud-provider":">=0.0.1 <0.2.0","harvester-csi-provider":">=0.0.1 <0.2.0"}'
    ```
