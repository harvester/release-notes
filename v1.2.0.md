# Install
<!--- TO-DO -->
Harvester can be installed with the [ISO](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/install/iso-install/) image or via [PXE](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/install/pxe-boot-install/) boot.

# Highlights
<!--- TO-DO -->
- The system footprint of Harvester is reduced, better fitting Edge use cases. See [3262](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3262).
- When mirgrating VMs in Harvester, the resource limit of `ResourceQuota` is increased based on the the specifications of the target VM before migration. When the migration is complete, the resource limit of `ResourceQuota` is decreased or restored to it's previous value. See [3124](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3124).
- Harvester supports adding an emulated Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to a VM. TPM is a cryptoprocessor that secures hardware using cryptographic keys and is a hard requirement of Windows 11. See [2910](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2910).
- Harvester supports passing through SR-IOV capable network virtual functions (VFs) to workload VMs. See [2763](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2763).
- When VMs are being migrated, pods are drained from the node during maintence mode. See [2723](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2723). 
- Pod limit per node increased to 200. See [2707](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2707). 
- Harvester node driver supports multiple NICs and multiple disks. See [2426](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2426).
- Harvester supports installing a Container Storage Interface (CSI) in your Harvester cluster to support and use external storage as the VM's non-system data partition. See [2405](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2405).
- Enable `harvester-seeder` to configure `Out-of-Band Access` for a node and map the corresponding underlying hardware to a node. See [2318](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2318). 
- Harvester supports creating a VM template with data from an existing VM, including root and data disks. See [571](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/571). 
- New installation mode supports installing Harvester to a machine without configuring the node. See [2198](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2198).
