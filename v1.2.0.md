# Install

Harvester can be installed with the [ISO](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.2/install/iso-install/) image or via [PXE](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.2/install/pxe-boot-install/) boot.

# Highlights

- The new `Branding` setting allows an administrator to customize the product name, logos and color scheme. See [#3396](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3396).
- The system footprint of Harvester is reduced, better fitting Edge use cases. See [#3262](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3262).
- Automatic adjustment of ResourceQuota during migration. When migrating VMs in Harvester, the resource limit of `ResourceQuota` is increased based on the specifications of the target VM before migration; and automatically decreased or restored to its previous value when the migration is complete. See [#3124](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3124).
- Harvester supports adding an emulated Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to a VM. TPM is a cryptoprocessor that secures hardware using cryptographic keys and is a hard requirement of Windows 11. See [#2910](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2910).
- Harvester supports passing through SR-IOV capable network virtual functions (VFs) to workload VMs. See [#2763](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2763).
- Add `rancher-vcluster`(experimental) addon and bare-metal container support for the Harvester cluster. See [#2679](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2679).
- Harvester node driver(v0.6.5) supports multiple NICs and multiple disks. See [#2426](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2426).
- Harvester supports installing third-party Container Storage Interface (CSI) in your Harvester cluster to support and use external storage as the VM's non-root data disks. See [#2405](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2405).
- Enable `harvester-seeder` addon to configure `Out-of-Band Access` for a node and map the corresponding underlying hardware to a node. See [#2318](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2318).
- New installation mode supports installing Harvester to a machine without configuring the node. See [#2198](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2198).
- Introduce new Harvester cloud provider design in the guest RKE2 Kubernetes cluster and add VM load balancer support in the Harvester cluster. See [#2134](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2134).
- Harvester supports draining the node when entering maintenance mode. See [#2723](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2723).
- Harvester supports creating a VM template with data from an existing VM, including root and data disks. See [#571](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/571).
- Pod limit per node increased to 200. See [#2707](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2707).

- The `harvester_config` of terraform-provider-rancher2 v1.25.0 and v3.0.0 are incompatible. See [#3997](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3997).
- When creating an IP Pool, the **Project** drop-down list is missing in the MCM (rancher-manager-support) view. See [#3984](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3984).
- When you upgrade from Harvester v1.1.2 to v1.2.0 and the **pcidevices-controller** addon is **Enabled**, no PCI Devices are displayed. See [#3957](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3957).
- When you upgrade from Harvester v1.1.2 to v1.2.0, you are unable to restore an existing VM snapshot. See [#3943](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3943).
- When viewing Harvester cluster from **Virtualization Management** page in Rancher, project members cannot see a newly created volume from the **Volumes** page. See [#3873](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3873).
- When you upgrade from Harvester v1.1.2 to v1.2.0, a change in Rancher causes upgrading RKE2 to fail because the `local-rke-state` secret is the wrong type. See [#3858](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3858).
- When editing a Host configuration, you cannot view or edit Disk tags. See [#3849](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3849).
- When creating an RKE2 cluster, the cluster's volumes and networks differ from the final configuration. See [#3786](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3786).
- When a node has a memory size of more than 1000 GB, the node resources on the **Host** page are not displayed correctly. See [#3607](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3607).
- When creating **Output** or **Cluster Output**, the output provider **OpenSearch** is missing. See [#3589](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3589).
- VM with hotplug volume gives IO error after deleing hotplug volume pods twice. See [#3586](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3586).
- The setting controller does not reprocess the value when there is an error. See [#3519](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3519).

- Volume created by the Harvester CSI driver gets deleted after reprovisioning RKE2 nodes. See [#3272](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3272).
- During an upgrade, multiple nodes are cordoned off, causing the upgrade to be stuck waiting for volumes to become healthy. See [#3216](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3216).
- Time sync config and time sync monitoring missing. See [#3133](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3133).
- `server_url` with `https://` but without the port `:443` causes node join to fail. See [#2737](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2737).
- No resource limits set for the Kubevirt pods in `harvester-system` namespace. See [#2729](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2729).
- An upgrade is stuck with a node in "Pre-drained" state since the node's volume has too many system snapshots. See [#2640](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2640).
- After configuring the MTU attribute of the **Network Config** , the associated bridge interface still uses the default value of `1500`. See [#4353](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/4353).
