      the node configuration to increase the storage capacity of the node.

# Note
* Previously in Harvester v0.2.0, we've provided the option to enable the
  embedded Rancher server. This option has been removed from Harvester v0.3.0.
  To use Rancher with Harvester, please install Rancher v2.6.1 separately from
  Harvester. You can also spin up a VM with Rancher v2.6.1 to try out the
  integration features.
* Upgrade is not supported from previous version to v0.3.0 version.
    * We're investigating a manual upgrade process starting with v0.3.0. Will keep the community posted.
    * One click upgrade will be supported starting with v1.0.0 release.
* TODO: Air gap/proxy environment
