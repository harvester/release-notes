## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/index), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/pxe-boot-install). For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/requirements) section of the documentation.


## Upgrade

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/upgrade/index).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The [documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/upgrade/v1-4-0-to-v1-4-1) contains information about upgrade-related issues.
> 
> If Harvester v1.4.0 was originally installed and the system was configured to use a separate data disk, perform the following steps to prevent the upgrade from getting stuck in the "Waiting Reboot" state:
> - Check the disk usage of the operating system images on each node before starting the upgrade.
> - Convert `passive.img` to a sparse file.
